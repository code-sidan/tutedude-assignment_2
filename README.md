# Assignment 2 – Module 3: Control Structures in Python


## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Description
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is **even** or **odd** .It uses **integer division** (`//`) and multiplication to determine divisibility by 2.

### Working Principle
1. The user enters a number.
2. The number is divided by 2 using integer division (`//`).
3. The result is multiplied back by 2.
4. If the result matches the original number → the number is **even**.
5. Otherwise → the number is **odd**.
6. The result is displayed using an `if-else` statement.

### Expected Output
Enter a number: 10
10 is an even number

Enter a number: 15
15 is an odd number

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a While Loop

### Description
This program calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to 50** using a `while` loop.

### Working Principle
1. A counter starts at 1.
2. A total variable starts at 0.
3. While the counter is less than or equal to 50:
   - Add the counter value to the total.
   - Increment the counter by 1.
4. Print the final total after the loop ends.

### Expected Output
the sum of integers 1 to 50 is: 1275
